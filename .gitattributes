# Universal Rules for Text-Based Files (Important for Collaboration)
* text=auto   # Automatic text file detection and line-ending normalization

# Python-Specific Optimizations 
*.py diff=python  # Use a Python-aware diff driver (if you have one)

*.pyc -diff   

# Common IDEs (Adjust as needed for your team)
.idea/ -diff 
**/.vscode/ -diff  # Assuming some collaborators use VS Code

# Other Potential Additions (Consider if relevant to your project)
*.json diff=json  # Diff driver for JSON files (if you have a compatible one)
data/* -diff  # Ignore diffs on a whole 'data' directory if non-textual
*.png -diff  # Treat image files as binary, not text
